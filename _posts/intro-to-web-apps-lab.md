## üåç Introduction to Web Applications ‚Äì Hack The Box Academy

**Problem**: Understand the basics of how web applications work and how attackers exploit them.

**Approach**:  
I completed the Web Applications introductory course on Hack The Box Academy, which included both theory and lab-based scenarios.

**Tools Used**:
- Bash
- Hack The Box Academy
- Burp Suite (optional)

**Key Activities**:
- Analyzed HTTP requests and responses
- Investigated client-server architecture
- Simulated web-based attacks (e.g., URL tampering, form manipulation)

**Lessons Learned**:
- Web applications rely heavily on HTTP protocol behavior
- Understanding session handling, input validation, and web architecture is vital for defense
